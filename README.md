Malicious Redirect Cyber Incident
=============================

**Description:**

This report provides an in-depth analysis of a security incident that occurred at YummyRecipesForMe.com. The purpose of this report is to document the incident, explain its root cause, identify the network protocols involved, and recommend solutions to prevent similar incidents in the future.

**Incident Scenario:**

On 20th Nov 2024 the cooking website YummyRecipesForMe.com experienced a major security breach. The incident was initiated by a disgruntled former employee who targeted the website's administrative account using a **brute force attack**. This attack involved repeated attempts to guess the admin password, which was still set to its default value. Once the attacker successfully gained access, they proceeded to embed malicious JavaScript into the website's source code.

The malicious code caused website visitors to be prompted to download an executable file under the guise of a "browser update." Upon running the file, users were redirected to a fraudulent website, **greatrecipesforme.com**, which contained malware. The attacker then changed the administrative password to block the legitimate website owner from regaining control of the admin panel.

Several customers reported suspicious activity, including:
- Unusual prompts to download a file.
- Browser redirection to a different URL.
- Slower-than-usual performance on their personal devices after interacting with the website.

This prompted an investigation by the cybersecurity team.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Cause of the Incident:**
   - **Brute Force Attack:** The attacker exploited the use of a weak, default administrative password, repeatedly guessing until they gained access.
   - **Lack of Preventive Measures:** No mechanisms (e.g., account lockout or CAPTCHA) were in place to prevent brute force attempts.

2. **Nature of the Compromise:**
   - The attacker embedded malicious JavaScript into the website’s codebase. This code:
     - Prompted users to download a file (malware).
     - Redirected browsers to **greatrecipesforme.com** after running the file.
   - The attacker locked out legitimate users by changing the admin password.

3. **Customer Impact:**
   - Malware installation led to slow computer performance and potential data compromise.
   - Browser redirection exposed users to further threats from the fraudulent website.

4. **Network Protocols Used:**
   - **DNS (Domain Name System):** Resolved IP addresses for both **yummyrecipesforme.com** and **greatrecipesforme.com**.
   - **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Used to load webpages and initiate the malware download.
   - **Executable File Execution:** Triggered the redirection to the malicious site.

5. **Investigation Process:**
   - **Tcpdump Logs:** The network traffic analysis revealed:
     - DNS requests for both websites involved in the attack.
     - HTTP requests used to download the malware and redirect browsers.
   - **Source Code Analysis:** Malicious JavaScript was identified in the website's source code.
   - **Customer Reports:** Confirmed browser redirection and suspicious downloads.

6. **Evidence Collected:**
   - Tcpdump log data capturing DNS and HTTP activity.
   - Screenshots of the malicious prompts.
   - Customer complaints and testimonials.
   - Source code showing injected JavaScript.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
   - **Why:** Adds a second layer of verification, requiring a one-time password (OTP) or biometric data, making brute force attacks ineffective.
   - **How:** All administrative accounts should be required to use 2FA for login.

2. **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**
   - **Why:** Weak and default passwords are a common vulnerability.
   - **How:** Require administrators to create complex passwords and update them regularly.

3. **Enable Account Lockout Policies:**
   - **Why:** Limits the number of login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
   - **How:** Temporarily lock accounts after a specified number of failed attempts.

4. **Use CAPTCHA on Login Pages:**
   - **Why:** Distinguishes between human users and automated bots, preventing brute force scripts.
   - **How:** Add CAPTCHA challenges to the login form.

5. **Monitor Network Activity with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**
   - **Why:** Identifies unusual traffic patterns and potential brute force attacks in real time.
   - **How:** Deploy IDS tools to monitor and log suspicious activity.

6. **Regular Security Audits:**
   - **Why:** Identifies vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
   - **How:** Conduct periodic code reviews, penetration testing, and server checks.

7. **Educate Employees on Security Best Practices:**
   - **Why:** Human error is often a significant factor in security breaches.
   - **How:** Train employees on the importance of secure credentials and adherence to company security policies.

---

**Conclusion:**

This incident highlights critical security lapses, including the use of weak passwords and the absence of preventive measures against brute force attacks. The attack compromised both the company’s website and its customers' trust. Implementing the recommended measures, such as enforcing 2FA, monitoring network activity, and educating employees, will significantly reduce the likelihood of similar incidents in the future.
